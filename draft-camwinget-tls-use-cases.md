# Introduction

The current TLS 1.3 specification employs ephemeral techniques that prohibits the means for a "proxy" to be inserted to serve some scenarios.   This document describes some of the use cases to demonstrate the need for such a "proxy" capability.

## Requirements notation

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
2119, BCP 14 {{RFC2119}}.

# TLS 1.3 Overview
